# BionicML

This program allows to execute five types of parallel bioinspired algorithms for Feature Selection (FS). These algorithms work with a dataset of Electroencephalography (EGG) and consist of wrapper methods which use the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to calculate the fitness of the subsets of features. The output of the program is the best subset of features found as well as the accuracy achieved by KNN.

The program has an additional option to measure the execution time and energy consumed by the processor during execution. These data, as well as the solution and accuracy are registered in the folder of the respective algorithm used. The purpose of this feature is to adjust formulas of time and energy by linear regression, which is done by the program Linear_regression.py
